# Snake

The project was created with my son (8 years). He love programming in "Scratch 2" [https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/]
and this is his first
experience with real programming.


Here you can see an example of how you can draw using HTML5 canvas in the Angular2 application.

## How to play

* Start the project (command `ng serve` in root project folder) and open page in a browser: `localhost:4200`. 
* Press the button on the page.
* move mouse pointer onto game area.
* press mouse button - the snake will start a movement in direction of mouse pointer.
* if you leave the mouse button - the snake will continue movement with last remember direction.
